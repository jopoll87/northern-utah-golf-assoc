      <h1>Welcome to the Northern Utah Golf Association</h1>
      <h2>Starting Spring 2025</h2>
      <p>Are you tired of playing the same golf course every single week? Are you tired of your winnings only being available as "Club House" credit? Join us in the creation of the Northern Utah Golf Association (NUGA). The idea behind this new association comes from missing the excitement of playing many courses throughout the year. When we joined the Men's Association at Riverside, we found ourselves only playing there. By the end of the season, we were almost dreading our next round. Another reason is the frustration of having winnings but only being able to use them on things that the Club House can get for us. There were always items we wanted that we could not get because they didn't have an account with that company. We also would have loved to use our winnings to help pay for our golf, but that was not allowed.</p>
      <p>NUGA is a great opportunity to play all over Davis and Weber Counties, have competition, play different formats, have weekly payouts, and still have a club championship at the end of the season. 100% of the money to join and for the weekly buy-ins will be used as prize money. We will also be looking for sponsorship opportunities to add prize money to the pot. We are going to use the model of Riverside to run our association. You will have Monday-Friday to play your round at that week's assigned course. You will be able to choose between 9 holes or 18 holes every week. Your weekly buy-in needs to be sent via Venmo. Once you have submitted your scorecard and your payment has been verified, you will be added to that week's play. If you do not submit your scorecard or payment by the end of the day on Friday, then you will not be entered in for that week. Winnings will be paid out via Venmo every Sunday so that you can use your winnings for the next week's round or however your heart desires.</p>
      <p>To make everything as fun and fair as possible we will flight the weekly play. You must sign up for and establish an official GHIN Handicap. You can sign up <a href='https://www.uga.org' target='_blank' >HERE</a>. Once you have your GHIN, you will need to share that number with us. We will track your handicap to flight you appropriately throughout the year.</p>
